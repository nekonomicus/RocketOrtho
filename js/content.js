        **Tendonitis**: Tendonitis is inflammation or irritation of a tendon, the thick fibrous cords that attach muscle to bone. It causes pain and tenderness just outside a joint.
        
        **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome**: This condition causes numbness, tingling, or weakness in the hand due to pressure on the median nerve in the wrist.
        
        **Bursitis**: Bursitis is inflammation of the fluid-filled pads (bursae) that act as cushions at the joints. Common areas include the shoulder, elbow, and hip.
